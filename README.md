# epydoc4jinja

extending the original project to provide modern features

## Motivation

Since the last release of the project many things have changed. \
Web Site are not created that way anymore. Mostly because they don't provide
responsive capabilities. \
And Documention is created and hosted differently nowadays, too. \
To adapt the great parsing work to modern outputs some changes and extensions are required. \
The objective of the fork is to provide these functionalities.
